This method combines a convolutional architecture using pre-trained weights from the VGG16 model with a Mask R-CNN architecture to perform classification and localisation jointly. We finetuned most hyper-parameters from the VGG16 model and the Mask R-CNN model to allow both models to generalise properly for classification and localisation tasks
